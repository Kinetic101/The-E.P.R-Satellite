# The-E.P.R-Satellite
This was made for partial completion of EEE 192 - EEE Laboratory VI.

This is the source code for the can satellite (cansat) project which utilizes the PIC32 MCU for the cansat itself and the PIC32 and ESP32 MCUs for the ground station. 

The cansat measures air quality by using off-the-shelf sensors which then sends the data to the ground station.

The PIC32 in the ground station is responsible for wirelessly receiving data from the cansat while the ESP32 is responsible for post-processing i.e., data viewing via a dedicated local webpage.
